            Retirement Planning involves the disciplined accumulation of a
            planned amount of money, by a specific target date. This money must
            be sufficient to provide you with an inflation-proof income that
            will comfortably outlast you, as well as your dependent partner. In
            addition, this fund must be sufficient to take care of medical
            emergencies, allow you to travel, as well as enjoy the free time
            you'll have at hand once you hang up your work boots for good!
          </p>

          <p>
            Most of us in India do not adopt a planned approach to our
            retirement planning, and this often leads to much strife in our
            twilight years.

            <h3>Increasing Lifespans</h3>
            <p>
              On average, lifespans in India are going up by 5 years every
              decade - and so is the risk of your outliving your savings.

            <h3>Inflation</h3>
            <p>
              Long term inflation in India has hovered around 6.5%. A soft drink
              now costs more than 15 times what it did when your parents were
              your age!

            <h3>Nuclear Families</h3>
            <p>
              More than 70% of urban households now have only one couple. With
              joint families breaking down, one needs to be more retirement
              ready.
